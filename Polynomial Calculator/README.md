The main objective of this project is to implement a system for polynomial processing. We must transpose the real world objects into classes. In this way, we will use an Object Oriented Programming technique called abstraction.


We must also pay attention to some other principles of Object Oriented Programming such as: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, these being some secondary objectives of the project.
