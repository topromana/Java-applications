The main objective of this application is to work with threads and understand the basic concepts behind it, along with being able to simulate an application of this type which is frequently encountered in the real world, since we encounter queues in many real life examples. 
Another objective would be to learn to how work with timers and how to synchronize the threads in order to ensure thread safety, and the correct functioning of our system. 
The main structures that we used in this project are Atomic Integer and Blocking Queue. The Blocking Queue is used to help us model multiple objects of type Task inside the Server class. The Atomic Integer is used to implement the waiting period.
