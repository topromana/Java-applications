The main objective of this current program is to implement an application for order processing. We must transpose the real world objects : client, product and order into classes. In this way, we use layered architecture to design the class and to make the application as “user-friendly” as possible, and to look as much alike as a real order application as possible.


We also need to pay attention to all the principles of Object Oriented Programming: abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance, along with implementing the layered architecture pattern, these being the other objectives of the project.


The main structure used in this project would be the Array List. It’s primary purpose is to help us store the lists of Clients, Orders or Products, resulted after executing certain queries. 


The main detail of the way in which this application is designed lays in the layered architecture pattern, which is one of the many design patterns. This is the most common architecture pattern, also known as the n-tier architecture pattern. The basic idea behind this is the fact that the functionality behind this application is grouped into distinct layers that are stacked vertically on top of each other. Communication between layers is explicit and loosely coupled, meaning that data moves from one layer to another, but it’s not allowed to ‘jump’ over an adjacent layer.
